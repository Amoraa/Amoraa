# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is **Tatiana Kashcheeva**, I am a 6th-semester student in the Honours Bachelor of Technology â€“ Software Development program at Seneca Polytechnic, currently looking for a Co-op job for my WIL semester 

I am a passionate student interested in fields like Data Structures and Algorithms, Frontend and Backend development, and UI/UX design. I have a strong academic background, and a GPA of 4.0. I am also very creative, result-oriented, and easy to adapt to change. I am ready to face the challenges of learning new skills.

I am **working on** a group project using Next js, Tailwind, Typescript, MongoDB, and Postgres.

Also, I am **currently learning** AI fundamentals with a Codecademy course as I feel that it is the future of the world and I want to keep up. When it comes to college I am studying how to make mobile applications with React Native. Other courses that I am taking are Design Patterns in Enterprise, Advanced UI Design, and Statistics. I feel like those courses will improve my skills and knowledge in the industry. More than that I am currently working on a capstone project in a team of 4
